Dear Professor ZHENG Hong,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Kifayat Ali, and I am from Pakistan. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology in 2020 and have been working as a backend developer specializing in Python and PHP.

I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing a Master's degree at your esteemed institution under your supervision through the Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC). Your research machine learning aligns perfectly with my academic interests and career goals. I am eager to contribute to your work in these critical fields and enhance my knowledge and skills.

I would be honored if you could consider my application for supervision and provide me with an acceptance letter for the CSC scholarship. Attached to this email are my CV  for your review.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of working under your guidance.

Best regards,  
Kifayat Ali
